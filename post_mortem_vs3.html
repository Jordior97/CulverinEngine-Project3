                   First, we started working as a team by departments, although this caused high communication problems. Then we divided these departments and formed Scrum teams so the communication between the members of that teams increased considerably.

                       Although this didn’t end up being a state of art, since the communication between scrums, with dependencies between them, decreased considerably causing high delay problems at the time of internal deliveries.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        As a countermeasure, we formed a Scrum of Scrums where there was a scrum master for scrum and a scrum master that included both scrums. In this way the scrum master of scrums was responsible of making sure of the communication, if necessary, of the subjects that belonged to both groups.
                    </p>

                     <p>
                   After doing this we achieved a high level of communication, although the Stage of Art wasn’t achieved at any time.

                       <p>
                   It should be noted that communication was a problem throughout the development, so we looked to optimize the way of sharing information of what was being done. An example would be a google sheet with a list of scenes, the availability of being able to work in each of them and who was working in that scene. This doc was one of the most useful when working, so as not to overwrite the work.

                        One of the most critical points of the project has been the lack of time in practically all the versions, either due to the short time of the milestones or the other subjects with which we had. As we have seen several times forced to cut content in order to properly complete the release. And for that reason we ended up making a contingency plan for almost every scrum, where the critical parts were focused first and blocks of possible content were made that had to be removed.

                        After two and a half years in the degree, and after having made several small games made by small groups, we all wanted to get to make a game that would be close to the result of a game made by a large group of developers.

                        As in any video game development team, one of the most important parts to reach the goal, as well as to speed up the work is communication. Being a team of 35 people we have observed that communication is very complex when you exceed teams of 8-9 people.

                        With the scrums, which were applied as well as the theory says, between 4 and 9 people, communication improved considerably. This does not mean that the communication will improve 100%, it could be seen that the communication between scrums in the beginning was practically null. Perhaps the fault came as a result of the communication between scrum masters, producer and leads with the teams.

                         The main problem of the audio in this project was the lack of adaptation to which one of the team members will leave the course. In this case he was in charge of all the audio and music.

                    <p>
                        After the production of the first 2 versions of the soundtrack, the expectations of having a good final audio result increased considerably, making the audio manager take on importance.After a while the boy disappeared due to family problems, this caused a void around this part of the development. This lack we thought was going to be temporary so the production effort in audio was left aside, which caused us a significant decline of the quality of the final product.
                    </p>
 					<br>
                     <p>
                   		At the same time, the audio system was integrated without any problem, adding the audio component and some audio effects such as reverberation areas, attenuations, etc
                    </p>
					<br>
                       <p>
                   		To the practically 2 weeks later we realized that this lack could suppose a disaster as far as the result as much artistic as playable of the game. So we resume a line of development in terms of audio.This time and after having seen that the required level of recordings & sounds did not reach the required standards, it was decided to extract audios from the game of thrones series, as well as the search of libraries provided by the university.

                        After each presentation of each release, the leaders and the producer got together to analyze the presentation, and administer the requirements provided by the teachers for the next delivery.During this meeting, the objectives to be followed were initially set, and then all team members were distributed in scrums.Then, among the members of the scrum, they subdivided the objectives into tasks and assigned them to the most appropriate person to perform that task.

                        In the middle of the project we achieved this workflow more or less ideal, with some problem in the communication between scrums, even so the constant level of work and the dedication of each and every one of the members of the group have really achieved a product that meets expectations, despite the audio, the overall result has been quite remarkable. As for the engine, the final result has been well above our expectations.
